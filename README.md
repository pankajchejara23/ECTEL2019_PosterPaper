[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.1007/978-3-030-29736-7_62.svg)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-29736-7_62)


**This repository contains the source code, data, and resources for the paper:**  
_"Exploring the triangulation of dimensionality reduction when interpreting multimodal learning data from authentic settings"_ (presented at EC-TEL 2019).

## 📚 About the Project

In this project, we investigate how **dimensionality reduction techniques** can be applied to analyze learners’ digital traces across authentic educational settings.  
Our goal is to develop methods that **capture complex learning behaviors** by combining data from multiple sources, including logs and observational data.

Key highlights:
- **Multi-modal data fusion**: Integrating clickstreams, assessments, and sensor data.
- **Dynamic activity modeling**: Understanding learner behavior over time.
- **Machine learning and data mining**: Applied to detect learning patterns and support educational decision-making.
